== Welcome to Rapper

Rapper is a rails based business frontend to allow users to map existing dimensional elements to new derived attributes. Mappings generally fall into one of three categories 1-to-1 where a single column is renamed for a more descriptive display value on reporting. Many-to-1 where one or more existing attributes are mapped to a new grouping element. Finally a 1-to-Many mapping expands existing attributes to many new rows. This is usually performed against a time element along some arithmetic mean. 

== Scripts or SQL

Artifacts from wrapper projects are ruby scripts or sql statements that can be scheduled to create new derived dimensions outside the normal process of IT datawarehouse upgrades.
